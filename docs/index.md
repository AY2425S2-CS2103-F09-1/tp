**TravelHub is a desktop application to manage customer profiles and trip details, making it easy to customize itineraries, access daily schedules, manage contacts for services like accommodations, transport, and activities - ensuring a personalized and efficient travel planning experience.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using TravelHub, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TravelHub, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
