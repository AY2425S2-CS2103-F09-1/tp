Hi my name is Ang Yong Xiang Adwin, or you can call me Adwin for short.

I am a Year 2 Computer Science Student in NUS. I came from Ngee Ann Polytechnic where I studied Information Technology Diploma.

Fun Fact about myself, the two times I have been to US were both sponsored by Ngee Ann Polytechnic (got quite lucky there).
